##  Visualizing data from FOAM’s TCR

FOAM’s Spatial Index & Visualizer has become a fascinating playground for people collaboratively coming to consensus around location data in a decentralized fashion.

This proposal focuses on kickstarting the visualization of FOAM TCR’s data by providing visualization tools and experiments that let’s the community view the data in a more visual way.

The blockchain and crypto ecosystem is already as complex for an average joe to understand. And when the user can’t visualize how things work, they can’t really wrap their heads around the concept.

Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is easier than poring over raw numbers. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner.
These tools + visualizations would help all users - including power users - to go through the data in a more visual way than currently possible.

### Repo constains these three visualizations

1. VizPOIAnalytics
2. VizCartographerJourney
3. VizDataOverGlobe

**Steps to run the project locally in development mode are:**

```
1. Installing dependencies

> npm install

Clone the repository and cd into `/foamviz` folder.
Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

2. Setting up .env file

Go to root of the project and setup an .env file with content:

REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = <YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN> 

3. Starting the local server 

> npm start

This will start the server.
Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
